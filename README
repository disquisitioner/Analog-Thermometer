Simple Arduino-based recording thermometer designed to use the
TMP36 analog temperature sensor operating at 3.3V.

The sensor is read every second and readings are averaged over a
five minute period.  Readings are displayed on an LCD display and 
also output via the Serial Monitor so they can be uploaded through
a connected PC.
